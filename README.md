# xrb-sens-datashare
A repository for sharing intermediate and final data products in machine and/or human-readable formats coming out of the JINA-CEE xrb reaction rate sensitivity project.

## Getting Data

If you're familiar with `git`, then you can easily get the data with the usual git workflow:

```
git clone git@github.com:adam-m-jcbs/xrb-sens-datashare.git
```

This repo is open, so no credentials or account should be needed for read (clone) access.

If using `git` isn't convenient for you but you're fine to use common \*nix shell commands, you can get data from the `raw` url for this project ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-m-jcbs/xrb-sens-datashare/master/](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-m-jcbs/xrb-sens-datashare/master/)).  For example,

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-m-jcbs/xrb-sens-datashare/master/README.md -o README.md
```
will download this `README.md` file to your local working directory.

## Key Available Data
